        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The history of strawberry cheesecake ice cream is unclear. However, we do know that early ice creams and other snow/ice treats date back as far as 1254. Even the USâ€™s first president, George Washington, served ice cream to his guests! However, during the 1700s, only rich people could afford the treat. Lucky for those living in the 21st century, ice cream is widely available to everyone at grocery stores, restaurants, and cafes.</p>
