	<h1>About the creator of Tastebud Town</h1>
	<!--Brief paragraph about the creator-->
	<p>
		The creator of this website is a programmer working from a device connected to a switch&sbquo; which in turn&sbquo; is connected to a router. She first came up with the idea for Tastebud Town when her amazing professor assigned creating a webpage for homework. The creator wanted to combine her love of food with coding&sbquo; and so this website was born. She has been working on <span id="tastebudtown">Tastebud Town</span> for Fellow Foodies since.

	<p>Three of her favourite pastimes are:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Coding</li>
		<li>Hanging out with her friends</li>

	</ol>
	<!--Closing sentence-->
	<p> When she is not doing any of those things&sbquo; the creator can be found reading sentimental books and watching comedy shows.</p>
