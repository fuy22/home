	<h1>About the creator of Tastebud Town</h1>
	

	<p>She is a programmer working from a device connected to a switch, which in turn, is connected to a router.</p>
		
	<p>The creator first came up with the idea for Tastebud Town when her amazing professor assigned creating a webpage for homework. 
		She wanted to combine her love of food with coding, and so this website was born. The creator has been working on <span id="tastebudtown">Tastebud Town</span> for Fellow Foodies since.</p>
		
	<p>Her long list of hobbies include, but are not limited to: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Coding</li>
			<li>Hanging out with her friends</li>
			<li>Swimming</li>
		</ol>
	
	
	<p> When she is not coding, the creator can be found reading sentimental books and watching comedy shows.
