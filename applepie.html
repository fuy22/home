            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Apple pie is a sweet, baked dessert that consists of a wheat crust with a soft, syrupy apple-and-sugar filling. It is usually served warm and sometimes with a scoop of ice cream.         </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Although apple pie is considered an American icon, its origins actually lie in Europe. The first recorded recipe came from England during the late 1300s and also included figs, the spice saffron, raisins and pears. In addition to that, old versions of the dessert lacked sugar. Crusts were not eaten; they were simply meant to hold the filling. Furthermore, crab apples - perfect for making cider but unsuitable for pies - were the only types of apples in North America until European settlers planted apple trees, which later led to the breeding of new variations of apples. </p>
