            <p>
                Although apple pie is considered an American icon&sbquo; its origins actually lie in Europe. The first recorded recipe came from England during the late 1300s and also included figs&sbquo; saffron (a spice)&sbquo; raisins&sbquo; and pears. In addition to that&sbquo; old versions of the dessert lacked sugar. Crusts were not eaten; they were simply meant to hold the filling. Now&sbquo; the whole pie is meant for eating &#8208; crust and all!
