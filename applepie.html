            <!--Paragraph describing apple pie-->
            <p>
                Apple pie is a baked dessert that consists of a wheat crust with a soft&sbquo; sweet apple-and-sugar filling. It is usually served warm and sometimes with a scoop of ice cream.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <!--Paragraph about the history of apple pie-->
            <p>
                Although apple pie is considered an American icon&sbquo; its origins actually lie in Europe. The first recorded recipe came from England during the late 1300s and also included figs&sbquo; saffron (a spice)&sbquo; raisins&sbquo; and pears. In addition to that&sbquo; old versions of the dessert lacked sugar. Crusts were not eaten; they were simply meant to hold the filling. Furthermore&sbquo; crab apples &#8208; perfect for making cider but unsuitable for pies &#8208; were the only types of apples in North America until European settlers planted apple trees&sbquo; which later led to the breeding of new variations of apples.
